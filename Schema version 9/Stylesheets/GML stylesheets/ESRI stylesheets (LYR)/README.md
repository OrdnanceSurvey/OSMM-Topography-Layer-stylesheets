# OS MasterMap Topography Layer
*Backdrop, Standard, Outdoor and Light styles*

These are **LYR** files for OS MasterMap Topography Layer for use in ArcMap. You will need to apply the post processing SQL scripts before using these stylesheets.

## Getting Started Guide

For help and advice please see the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OSMM-Topography-Layer-stylesheets/blob/master/Getting%20Started%20Guide%20-%20Styling%20OSMM%20Topography%20Layer.pdf)

## Note about draw speed
The advanced layer options have been switched on in order to control the draw order - this is so Slopes and Cliffs that have a diagonal line fill with transparent background, draw on top of other topographicarea features.

Switching this option off may help speed up redraw times. In order to get Cliff and Slope fills back on top, add the topographicarea layer again with only these two styles listed.
