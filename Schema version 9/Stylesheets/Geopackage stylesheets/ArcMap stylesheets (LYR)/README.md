# OS MasterMap Topography Layer
*Road, Outdoor, Light, Black and White, Standard and Greyscale styles*

These are **LYR** files for OS MasterMap Topography Layer for the GeoPackage data format.

In 2024 we updated our Outdoor, Road and Light styles to reflect our changes to the OS Maps API. You can read about the changes here: https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/base-map-style-updates. Our legacy styles remain available for those who want to use them.

In 2025 we added our new Black and White style.

## Getting Started Guide

For help and advice please see the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OSMM-Topography-Layer-stylesheets/blob/master/Getting%20Started%20Guide%20-%20Styling%20OSMM%20Topography%20Layer.pdf)

## Note about draw speed
The advanced layer options have been switched on in order to control the draw order - this is so Slopes and Cliffs that have a diagonal line fill with transparent background, draw on top of other topographicarea features.

Switching this option off may help speed up redraw times. In order to get Cliff and Slope fills back on top, add the topographicarea layer again with only these two styles listed.
