# OS MasterMap Topography Layer
*Road, Outdoor, Light and Standard styles*

These are **QML** files for OS MasterMap Topography Layer for the GeoPackage data format.

In 2024 we updated our Outdoor, Road and Light styles to reflect our changes to the OS Maps API. You can read about the changes here: https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/blog/base-map-style-updates. Our legacy styles remain available for those who want to use them.

## Getting Started Guide

For help and advice please see the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OSMM-Topography-Layer-stylesheets/blob/master/Getting%20Started%20Guide%20-%20Styling%20OSMM%20Topography%20Layer.pdf)

## Compatability note
These stylesheets are designed to work in QGIS version 3.28 or later*. The pre December 2024 stylesheets will continue to work in older versions of QGIS back to version 2.12.
 
*This is due to QGIS removing backward compatibility of stylesheets created in version 3.16 or later.
