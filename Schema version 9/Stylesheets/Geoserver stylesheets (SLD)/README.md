# OS MasterMap Topography Layer
*Backdrop, Standard, Outdoor and Light styles*

These are **SLD** stylesheets for OS MasterMap Topography Layer. You will need to apply the post processing SQL scripts before using these stylesheets.

## Getting Started Guide

For help and advice please see the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OSMM-Topography-Layer-stylesheets/blob/master/Getting%20Started%20Guide%20-%20Styling%20OSMM%20Topography%20Layer.pdf)

### GeoServer and Oracle

If using the SLDs in GeoServer with the data loaded into an Oracle database you may need to update all `<ogc:PropertyName>` values to be uppercase to match the data. Oracle column names are uppercase by default and an unquoted lowercase column name is treated as uppercase by the database.
